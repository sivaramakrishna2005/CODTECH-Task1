##Overview of the Project

Simple Calculator :- This is a java console application program that allows the user to perform simple arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division) of two numbers. The user inputs 2 numbers and which operation they want to preform the code does the algebraic then outputs whatever comes out.

Components

Scanner:

Scanner class:It is used to read the input available from an InputStream object (System. in stands for standard input).

Main Method:

The main method is the driver of our program; it asks the user for input, sends this to be calculated and displays what need.

Steps

Prompting for Input:

We ask to write first number

Then it prompts the user to enter second number.

The conole will display the options to be taken whether it is adding, subtracting, multiplying or dividing two numbers.

Performing the Calculation:

The program uses a switch statement to check the user input and determine which operations it is supposed to perform.

The operation is performed on the numbers that are provided.

And if the user opts for division and inputs zero as the second number then it would give an error message like this for a divided by 0 exception case.

Displaying the Result:

The user is provided with the result of the calculation.

If an invalid operation is selected, The error window will be showed.

Summary : This Simple Calculator program demonstrates basic concepts of user input, control flow, and arithmetic operations in Java. It serves as a useful example for beginners to understand how to build a console-based application that interacts with the user and performs calculations based on user input.
